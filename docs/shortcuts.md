# Keyboard Shortcuts

## In-App Shortcuts

These work when the Voice Notepad window is focused.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+R | Start recording |
| Ctrl+Space | Pause/resume recording |
| Ctrl+Return | Stop and transcribe |
| Ctrl+S | Save to file |
| Ctrl+Shift+C | Copy to clipboard |
| Ctrl+N | Clear editor |

## Global Hotkeys

Global hotkeys work system-wide, even when Voice Notepad is minimized or unfocused. Configure them in Settings > Hotkeys.

Default configuration:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| F14 | Start recording |
| F15 | Stop (discard) |
| F16 | Stop and transcribe |

F14-F20 (macro keys) are recommended because they rarely conflict with other applications. These keys are available on keyboards with programmable macro keys.

Three hotkey modes are available:

**Tap to Toggle** uses one key to toggle recording on/off, with a separate key to stop and transcribe.

**Separate Start/Stop** uses different keys for each action: start, stop (discard), and stop & transcribe.

**Push-to-Talk** records while you hold a key and stops when you release it. The action on release (transcribe or discard) is configurable.

On Wayland, global hotkeys work via XWayland. Some key combinations may be captured by your desktop environment.
